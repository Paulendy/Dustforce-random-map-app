## Notes
### Dustmod split.txt
Elements in order:
- The _n-th_ completed level of this session (resets on exiting Dustforce, not when resetting save to NG/NG+)
- The filename (e.g. Construction Site = "boxes")
- Finesse (starts at "0", increments per death and combo drop)
- Percentage of dust collected
- End time ("0" when early exited)
