# Random Map App
Inspired by a plugin in Trackmania, this app automatically loads players into
random custom levels. Where in Trackmania Author Medals give 1 point and Gold
Medals give free skips, here it's SS'ing and Any%'ing levels.

The level pool itself can be altered via various configurable settings, which
also includes other settings that change the rules of the game. The settings
consist of things such as:
- Filter levels by minimum SS count
- Filter levels by fastest WR SS time
- How many free starting skips are given to players
- Set seeds
- Free skip every "X" SS

And more.
